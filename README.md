### Hi there 👋


**QianhuiNi/QianhuiNi** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently a Ph.D student majoring in Psychology. My research area is social cognitive development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, html&css&js, data science, and UX research.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you want.
- ⚡ Fun fact about me: I am a big fan of the book series "Ghost Blows Out the Light"👻🕯️🌬️
